jjott - The best way to secure your coins
====

Owning Crypto-Currencies such as Bitcoin requires storing many numbers known as "Addresses" and "Private Keys" which represent our coins. It's risky to trust online wallets with these numbers because these are hacked all the time, and currency is stolen.

Luckily, technologies (such as [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) and [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki)) have been created to allow us to consolidate all of these numbers into a single mnemonic (referred to as **"Seed Phrase"**). Many online and hardware wallets create that seed phrase for us, but we still need to remember it and secure it. **If a seed phrase is stolen or lost, all of your coins are gone.**

The best way to secure your "Seed Phrase" is by breaking it up into a number of **Secret Shares**. These shares can be printed and trusted with friends or family. Each share means nothing on its own, but when combined together, shares will reveal the "Seed Phrase". Think of it as keys for a safe, one key alone can't open the safe, you need them all.

This tool allows you to back-up your seed phrase into printable shares. Later on, use this tool to scan the shares and reveal the original seed phrase.
